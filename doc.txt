    Project task is to create a RAG retrieval backend and provide the webhook.

    use flow : the input is either pdf, docx, mail or msg and is then parsed using the document_parser.py
    after this the context_chunker.py creates chunks of the parsed document
    this chunk is then fed to the remote vector embedding model which then makes vector embeddings
    and we also use pinecone too.

    lastly I'd want to integrate gemini model to return with a structured and smarter json response based on the query of the user about the document.
